A lightweight &amp; fast Objective-C implementation of a doubly linked list, including a cursor for easy traversal.

This collection does not support ARC due to technical and performance issues. To use this with ARC add the compiler flag `-fno-objc-arc` to the 'Compile Sources' build phase of your project for `CHTape.m`, `CHMutableTape.m`, and `CHTapeCursor.m`.
