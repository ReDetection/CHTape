CHTape
======

A fast implementation of a doubly linked list for Objective-C and a cursor for easy traversal.

This collection does not support ARC due to the decrease in speed ARC imposses. To use this in an ARC project add the compiler flag '-fno-objc-arc' to the Compile Sources Build Phase for CHTape.m, and CHTapeCursor.m.
